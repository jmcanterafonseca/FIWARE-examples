# FIWARE Examples Project

Here you can find different examples on *how to combine different FIWARE components* (Generic Enablers):

+ **Therm Controller**. An application that allows to monitor the temperature of a place.
It uses a Raspberry PI, a custom Iot Agent, Orion Context Broker and a Web Application for UI. It nicely integrates
other technologies such as *Web Sockets*. It is developed in *Node.js* and *Python*. 

All the applications developed here are intended to experimentation and learning. So you cannot consider them
as robust enough to be production ready.

## How to contribute

If you have any FIWARE example you think it might be worth to publishing please open an issue on this project. 

Enjoy!
